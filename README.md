Problem set Week 0 - Scratch Total Space

Upload the .sb3 file in Scratch at File > Load from your computer.

My project is a shooting spaceship game. The goal is to make the highest score destroying meteors. Use WASD to move and SPACEBAR to fire. 

Destroy as many meteors as you can and avoid collisions!
